# Data Science mini-projects
These Jupyter Notebooks are mini-projects for Data Scince, 
in which I tried to hone the following skills in this area:
1. Sentimental analysis
2. Work with Neural Networks and standard Machine Learning alghorithms
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Vizualization
4. Data loading and Data Cleaning
5. Working with Time Series
